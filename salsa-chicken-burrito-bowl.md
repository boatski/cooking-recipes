* 15oz black beans, rinsed
* 1.25 cup frozen whole kernel corn, or 15oz can
* 1 cup rice, uncooked
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded

## Directions
### Preparation
Rinse the rice thoroughly. Rinse the black beans. Shred the cheese, if needed.

### Cooking
Cover chicken breasts with taco seasoning. Place into an Instant Pot. Add salsa and chicken broth. Close and lock the lid, setting the valve to sealing. Select the poultry setting for fifteen minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally for five minutes. Shred the chicken and set aside.

Clean the Instant Pot pot or use another pot. Add the water, salt, and rice to the Instant Pot. Close and lock the lid, setting the valve to sealing. Select the high pressure cook setting for twenty-two minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally for ten minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and set aside.

Prepare a small sauce pan on low-medium heat while the rice is cooking. Add black beans and corn. Cover with lid and allow to cook for ten minutes. Remove from heat.

Split everything into six containers. Top with shredded cheddar cheese.
